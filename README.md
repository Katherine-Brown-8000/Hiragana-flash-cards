# Hiraganaflash cards

Hiragana is one of three writing systems used in  japanese. The other two are katagana and kanji.
I build this to help me practice my hiragana.
You can use the program by pastting the code from Hiragana flash cards into your code editor.
The program will ask you the amount of flash cards you want to pratice.
Your score will be obtained by dividing the number of answers you got right by the number of cards you entered.
